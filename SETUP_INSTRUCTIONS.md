## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top Customers Feature

### Database Setup

Create the `top_customers` view in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create view for top 10 customers by total spending
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW top_customers AS
SELECT
  customer_name,
  customer_phone,
  customer_email,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
  SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name, customer_phone, customer_email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Grant access to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT ON top_customers TO authenticated;
```

### Component Integration

The `CustomersBase` component is already created at:
- `src/components/rolebase/CustomersBase.tsx`

### Role-Specific Pages

Create page files for each role (examples):

#### CEO Page
**File:** `src/app/ceo/customers/page.tsx`
```typescript
import CustomersBase from '@/components/rolebase/CustomersBase'

export default function CEOCustomersPage() {
  return <CustomersBase role="ceo" />
}
```

#### Manager Page
**File:** `src/app/manager/customers/page.tsx`
```typescript
import CustomersBase from '@/components/rolebase/CustomersBase'

export default function ManagerCustomersPage() {
  return <CustomersBase role="manager" />
}
```

#### Board Page
**File:** `src/app/board/customers/page.tsx`
```typescript
import CustomersBase from '@/components/rolebase/CustomersBase'

export default function BoardCustomersPage() {
  return <CustomersBase role="board" />
}
```

#### Staff Page
**File:** `src/app/staff/customers/page.tsx`
```typescript
import CustomersBase from '@/components/rolebase/CustomersBase'

export default function StaffCustomersPage() {
  return <CustomersBase role="staff" />
}
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ File Storage System

### Supabase Storage Setup

1. **Create Storage Bucket** in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Storage section
   - Click "New bucket"
   - Name: `order-files`
   - Set as **Public** or **Private** (recommended: Private for security)
   - Click "Create bucket"

2. **Set Bucket Policies** (if using private bucket):

```sql
-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload order files"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'order-files');

-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to read files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view order files"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'order-files');

-- Policy: Allow CEO and Manager to delete files
CREATE POLICY "CEO and Manager can delete order files"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'order-files' AND
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role IN ('ceo', 'manager')
  )
);
```

3. **Adjust File Size Limits** (optional):
   - In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Storage
   - Adjust max file size as needed (default is usually 50MB)

### Component Updates

The `OrdersBase` component has been updated with:
- Expandable rows (click chevron icon or "Files" button)
- File upload with drag-and-drop UI
- File list with view/download and delete options
- Loading states and error handling

**File:** `src/components/rolebase/OrdersBase.tsx` ‚úÖ Already updated

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Notification System

### Browser Notification Permission

The system will automatically request browser notification permission when a user first visits the app. Users can:
- **Allow** - Receive native browser notifications
- **Block** - Only receive in-app notifications
- **Dismiss** - Asked again later

### Component Integration

Two new components have been created:

1. **GlobalNotifier** (Realtime subscription engine)
   - `src/components/GlobalNotifier.tsx` ‚úÖ Created
   - Subscribes to `orders` and `tasks` table changes
   - Provides notification context to entire app
   - Already integrated in `src/app/layout.tsx`

2. **NotificationsBase** (UI dropdown)
   - `src/components/rolebase/NotificationsBase.tsx` ‚úÖ Created
   - Bell icon with unread badge
   - Dropdown with notification list
   - Mark as read / clear functionality

### Add Notification Bell to Navbar

You need to add the notification bell to your navigation components. Here's how:

#### Example: Add to Role-Specific Layouts

**File:** `src/app/ceo/layout.tsx` (and similarly for manager, board, staff)

```typescript
import NotificationsBase from '@/components/rolebase/NotificationsBase'

export default function CEOLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing navbar/header */}
      <nav className="flex items-center justify-between p-4">
        <div>{/* Logo, menu items, etc. */}</div>
        
        {/* Add notification bell */}
        <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
          <NotificationsBase />
          {/* Other navbar items (user menu, theme toggle, etc.) */}
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Main content */}
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Supabase Realtime Configuration

Ensure Realtime is enabled for the required tables in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Enable replication for:
   - ‚úÖ `orders` table
   - ‚úÖ `tasks` table
3. Select which events to broadcast:
   - ‚úÖ INSERT
   - ‚úÖ UPDATE
   - ‚úÖ DELETE (optional)

### Notification Triggers

The system automatically sends notifications for:

#### Order Events
- üßæ **New Order Created** - When a new order is inserted
- üì¶ **Order Status Updated** - When order status changes
- üí∞ **Payment Status Updated** - When payment status changes

#### Task Events
- ‚úÖ **New Task Assigned** - When a new task is created
- üéâ **Task Completed** - When task status changes to completed

### Customizing Notifications

To add more notification types, edit `src/components/GlobalNotifier.tsx`:

```typescript
// Example: Add notification for new staff assignment
.on(
  'postgres_changes',
  { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'staff_assignments' },
  (payload) => {
    // Handle staff assignment changes
    addNotification({
      type: 'general',
      title: 'üë• New Staff Assignment',
      message: `You've been assigned to a task`,
      link: '/assignments',
    })
  }
)
```

- Check bucket policies allow authenticated users to upload
- Ensure file size is within limits
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify Supabase storage keys are set in `.env.local`

### Notifications Not Working

## üé® Styling Notes

All components use:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components (Card, Button, Input)
