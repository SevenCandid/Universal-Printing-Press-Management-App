## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Error 1: Syntax error with nested BEGIN
❌ **Before:** Functions created inside DO blocks  
✅ **After:** Functions created separately, triggers in DO blocks

### Error 2: customer_email column doesn't exist
❌ **Before:** View tried to use column before it existed  
✅ **After:** Columns created FIRST, then view uses them

### Error 3: View column order conflict
❌ **Before:** CREATE OR REPLACE with different column order  
✅ **After:** DROP view first, then CREATE fresh

### Error 4: RAISE NOTICE outside DO block
❌ **Before:** RAISE NOTICE used anywhere  
✅ **After:** RAISE NOTICE only inside DO $$ blocks

### Issue 5: Realtime not available
⚠️ **Handled:** Made optional, system works without it
