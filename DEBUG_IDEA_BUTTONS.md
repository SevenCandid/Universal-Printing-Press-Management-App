# Debug: Ideas Don't Have Edit/Delete Buttons

## Quick Test - Run in Browser Console:

Open the forum page, press F12, and paste this:

```javascript
// Check current user ID
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current User ID:', data?.user?.id);

// Check all posts with author IDs
const { data: posts } = await supabase.from('forum_posts').select('id, title, category, author_id');
console.log('All posts:', posts);

// Filter idea posts
const ideaPosts = posts.filter(p => p.category === 'idea');
console.log('Idea posts:', ideaPosts);

// Check if any are yours
console.log('Do you own any ideas?', ideaPosts.some(p => p.author_id === data?.user?.id));
```

## Most Likely Causes:

### 1. **Ideas Were Created by Someone Else**
- Edit/delete buttons only show for posts YOU created
- If someone else created the idea posts, you won't see the buttons
- **Solution**: Create a new idea post yourself and check if buttons appear

### 2. **currentUserId Not Set**
- The component might not have loaded your user ID yet
- **Test**: Refresh the page and wait 2-3 seconds

### 3. **Ideas Created Before Login**
- If ideas were created before you logged in, they might have a different author_id
- **Solution**: Create a fresh idea post while logged in

## Quick Fix Test:

1. **Create a new Idea post** yourself
2. Check if that new post has edit/delete buttons
3. If YES → Old ideas were created by someone else
4. If NO → There's a bug (run the console script above and share results)
