- Provides audit trail for attendance records
- Enables verification of legitimate workplace attendance

### 3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Clear error messages for location permission issues
- Specific feedback for different failure scenarios
- Extended timeout (15 seconds) for reliable GPS lock

---

## üë§ User Experience

### When Checking In/Out:

1. **User clicks "Check In" or "Check Out" button**
   - Loading indicator appears: "üìç Verifying your location..."

2. **Browser requests location permission** (if not already granted)
   - User must allow location access

3. **System verifies location**
   - Calculates distance from office
   - Checks if within 200m radius

4. **Success (Within Range)**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Checked in successfully!
   üìç Location verified: 45m from office
   ```

5. **Failure (Outside Range)**
   ```
   üö´ Check-in denied!
   
   You must be at the workplace to check in.
   
   Required: Within 200m of office
   Your distance: 1,247m away
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Messages & Solutions

### üö´ Location Access Denied
**Message**: "Location access denied! Please enable location permissions in your browser settings to check in."

**Solution**:
1. Click the lock/info icon in browser address bar
2. Change location permission to "Allow"
3. Refresh the page
4. Try checking in again

### üìç Location Unavailable
**Message**: "Location unavailable! Your device cannot determine your location. Please try again."

**Solution**:
1. Ensure GPS is enabled on device
2. Move to an area with better GPS signal (near windows/outdoors)
3. Wait a few seconds and try again

### ‚è±Ô∏è Location Request Timed Out
**Message**: "Location request timed out! Please check your GPS/location settings and try again."

**Solution**:
1. Check that device location services are ON
2. Ensure good GPS signal (avoid basements/deep indoors)
3. Wait 30 seconds and retry

### ‚ùå General Location Error
**Message**: "Location error! Please enable location services and try again."

**Solution**:
1. Restart browser
2. Check system location settings
3. Try different browser if issue persists

## üéØ Visual Indicators

### Active Status Indicator
On the attendance page, users will see:

```
üîí Location verification ACTIVE
You must be within 200m of the office to check in/out
```

This confirms that location verification is enabled and enforced.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Distance Calculation
Uses the **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculation:
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Accurate to within a few meters
- Industry-standard geolocation method

### GPS Settings
```javascript
{
  enableHighAccuracy: true,  // Use GPS instead of WiFi/cell tower
  timeout: 15000,            // 15 second timeout
  maximumAge: 0              // Always get fresh location
}
```

### Location Verification Logic
```javascript
if (distance > OFFICE_LOCATION.radius) {
  // DENY CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT
  // Show error with exact distance
  return
}
// ALLOW CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT
// Show success with distance confirmation
```

---

## üìä Logging & Debugging

### Console Logs (Developer Tools)
When checking in/out, the following information is logged:

```javascript
üìç Your Location: { latitude: 7.952845, longitude: -2.698234 }
üè¢ Office Location: { latitude: 7.952673, longitude: -2.698856, radius: 200 }
üìè Calculated Distance: 67 meters
‚úÖ Location verified - proceeding with check-in
```

This helps administrators debug location issues if users report problems.

---

## üîÑ Testing Location Verification

### How to Test:

1. **At the Office** (Should Work)
   - Click "Check In"
   - Should succeed with message showing distance (e.g., "45m from office")

2. **Away from Office** (Should Fail)
   - Click "Check In" from home or another location
   - Should fail with message showing actual distance
   - Example: "Your distance: 5,234m away"

3. **Edge of Radius** (200m Boundary)
   - Stand exactly 200m from office
   - Test if system correctly allows/denies
   - Helps verify radius is properly configured

---

## üö® Important Notes

### For Employees:
1. **Always enable location services** before attempting to check in/out
2. **Stand within 200m** of the office building
3. **Allow location permissions** when prompted by browser
4. **Use a reliable device** with working GPS
5. **Report any issues** to IT/HR immediately

### For Administrators:
1. Location verification **CANNOT be bypassed** (DEV_MODE = false)
2. All check-ins store GPS coordinates in database
3. Radius can be adjusted by changing `OFFICE_LOCATION.radius` value
4. Office coordinates can be updated if office relocates
5. Full audit trail available in attendance table

---

## üîß Configuration Changes

### To Adjust Verification Radius:
Edit `src/components/rolebase/AttendanceBase.tsx`:

```javascript
const OFFICE_LOCATION = {
  latitude: 7.952673,
  longitude: -2.698856,
  radius: 200, // Change this value (in meters)
}
```

Recommended values:
- **100m** - Very strict (building only)
- **200m** - Current setting (moderate)
- **500m** - Lenient (nearby area)

### To Update Office Location:
If office relocates, update coordinates:

```javascript
const OFFICE_LOCATION = {
  latitude: 7.952755,   // Current Sampa office
  longitude: -2.698595, // Current Sampa office
  radius: 200,
}
```

Get coordinates from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) by right-clicking on the location.
