## ✅ The Fix (3 Steps)

### 1. Run This File First (3 min)
**File:** `setup-new-features-FIXED.sql`

- No syntax errors
- Adds missing columns
- Works without Realtime
- Safe to run multiple times

```
Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → 
Copy entire content of setup-new-features-FIXED.sql → 
Click Run
```

---

### 2. Create Storage Bucket (1 min)
```
Supabase Dashboard → Storage → New Bucket
Name: company_files
Privacy: Private
Click: Create
```

---

### 3. Skip Realtime (For Now)
- Don't enable Realtime yet
- Everything works without it
- Enable later when available
- Notifications work, just need page refresh

---

## 🎯 What Changed

**OLD file:** `setup-new-features.sql`
- ❌ Had nested BEGIN blocks (syntax error)
- ❌ Assumed customer_email exists
- ❌ Required Realtime

**NEW file:** `setup-new-features-FIXED.sql`
- ✅ Proper function syntax
- ✅ Creates customer_email column first
- ✅ Realtime optional
- ✅ Helpful NOTICE messages
- ✅ Existence checks (safe to re-run)

---

## 📊 Expected Output

When you run the FIXED file, you'll see:

```
NOTICE:  Added customer_email column to orders table
NOTICE:  Added due_date column to orders table
NOTICE:  Added notes column to orders table
NOTICE:  Added updated_at column to orders table
NOTICE:  Created upload policy for company_files
NOTICE:  Created view policy for company_files
...
Success ✓
```

## 🧪 Test It

After running the fixed SQL:

```sql
-- 1. Check new columns exist
SELECT customer_email, due_date, notes 
FROM orders LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Check notifications table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications;

-- 3. Test in your app
http://localhost:3000/ceo/orders
# Click "Edit" button - should work now!
```

## 🔄 About Realtime

**Without Realtime (Your Current Setup):**
- ✅ Edit/Delete orders works
- ✅ File storage works
- ✅ Notifications created in database
- ⏰ Need to refresh page to see notifications

**When Realtime Available:**
- ✅ All above features
- ⚡ Live notification updates
- 🔔 Browser push notifications
- 🔴 Live badge updates

**Enable Later:**
```
Database → Replication → 
Enable "notifications" table →
Run: ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE notifications;
```
