- **Click to open** - Takes to forum post
- **Dismiss** - Click X or wait for auto-dismiss

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

### What We Need
- **Notification Permission** - To show browser notifications
- **That's it!** - No location, camera, microphone, etc.

### What We Track
- Which users have notification permission (browser-side only)
- Notification read status (in database)

### What We DON'T Do
- Send personal data to external services
- Track notification clicks (except in-app)
- Share notification data with third parties

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Notifications Not Showing
**Symptoms:** Created post but no notification appeared

**Check:**
1. Is notification permission granted?
   - Look at settings banner on forum page
2. Is browser notification permission enabled?
   - Check browser settings
3. Are you the post author?
   - Authors don't get notified of their own posts
4. Is sound/Do Not Disturb off?
   - Check system settings

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
console.log(Notification.permission)
// Should show: "granted"
```

---

### Issue 2: Database Notifications But No Browser Notifications
**Symptoms:** See notification in bell icon, but no browser popup

**Possible Causes:**
1. Notification permission not granted
2. Browser notifications disabled in system settings
3. Do Not Disturb mode active
4. Browser in background and system throttling notifications

**Solution:**
1. Check notification settings on forum page
2. Click "Enable Notifications" button
3. Check browser/system settings

---

### Issue 3: Too Many Notifications
**Symptoms:** Getting spammed with notifications

**Solution:**
Unfortunately, there's no "mute" feature yet. Options:
1. **Disable browser notifications** - Still get in-app notifications
2. **Browser settings** - Mute notifications from site
3. **System settings** - Enable Do Not Disturb mode

**Future Feature:** We can add a "Notification Preferences" page to control:
- Frequency (instant, digest, none)
- Types (posts only, announcements only, all)
- Quiet hours

---

### Issue 4: Notifications Not Working on iPhone
**Symptoms:** No browser notifications on iOS

**Explanation:**
iOS Safari has limited notification support. Notifications only work when:
- App is open
- Installed as PWA (Progressive Web App)

**Solution:**
1. **Install as PWA:**
   - Open Safari
   - Tap Share button
   - Tap "Add to Home Screen"
   - Open app from home screen
   - Notifications will work better

2. **Alternative:**
   - Use in-app notifications (bell icon)
   - Check frequently for updates

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

These features could be added later:

1. **Notification Preferences**
   - Mute notifications
   - Choose notification types
   - Set quiet hours
   - Digest mode (daily summary)

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email for important announcements
   - Daily digest option

   - Opt-in required

4. **Notification Groups**
   - Group similar notifications
   - "5 new posts in UPPress Forum"

5. **Smart Notifications**
