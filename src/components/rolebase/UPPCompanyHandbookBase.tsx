Much as every effort is made to represent in this policy most, if not all, the rules and responsibilities of the employee, the company will continue to implement changes as may deem profitable and beneficial to make it the leader in the digital printing business. This is a mutual employment agreement and either the employee or company may terminate employment at will or without cause and at any time.
