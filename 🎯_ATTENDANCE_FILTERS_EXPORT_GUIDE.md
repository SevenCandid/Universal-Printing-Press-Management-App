2. Verify profiles table has data
3. Check user role is 'ceo' or 'manager'
4. Refresh page

---

### Issue: "Export button disabled"

**Cause:** No attendance records for selected period

**Solution:**
1. Check the period filter
2. Try "This Month" or "All Time"
3. Verify you have attendance records
4. Check for console errors

---

### Issue: "PDF export fails"

**Solution:**
1. Run `npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable`
2. Restart dev server
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try again

---

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'jspdf'"

**Cause:** Packages not installed or build cache issue

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Custom dates not working"

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization

**Current Implementation:**
- Filters applied at database level (not in JavaScript)
- Indexed columns: `user_id`, `check_in`, `created_at`
- Limit of 30 records for history view
- Export includes all filtered records (no limit)

**Performance:**
- ✅ Fast queries (<100ms for typical datasets)
- ✅ Efficient filtering
- ✅ Scales to thousands of records

**Recommendations:**
- For large datasets (>10,000 records), add pagination
- Consider server-side export for very large exports
- Monitor query performance in Supabase dashboard
