# 🚀 Quick Vercel Auto-Deployment Setup

Your repository is ready for auto-deployment! Follow these steps to connect GitHub to Vercel.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Connect GitHub Repository to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Sign in (or create a free account)

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Or click "Import Git Repository"

3. **Connect GitHub**
   - Select "Connect GitHub" or "Configure GitHub App"
   - Authorize Vercel to access your repositories
   - Grant access to `Universal-Printing-Press-Management-App`

4. **Import Repository**
   - Find: `SevenCandid/Universal-Printing-Press-Management-App`
   - Click "Import"

5. **Configure Project Settings** (Auto-detected)
   - ✅ Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - ✅ Root Directory: `./`
   - ✅ Build Command: `npm run build`
   - ✅ Output Directory: `.next`
   - ✅ Install Command: `npm install`

6. **Add Environment Variables**
   Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables and add:
   
   **Production, Preview, and Development:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

7. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the first deployment (~2-3 minutes)

## 🔄 Auto-Deployment is Now Active!

Once connected:
- ✅ **Every push to `master`** → Auto-deploys to production
- ✅ **Every PR/branch** → Creates preview deployment
- ✅ **No manual steps needed** → Just push to GitHub!

## 📋 Your Current Configuration

Your `vercel.json` is already configured with:
```json
{
  "github": {
    "autoDeployOnPush": true,
    "autoJobCancelation": true
  }
}
```

This means auto-deployment is enabled once you connect the repository.

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

1. After connecting, make a small commit:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test auto-deployment"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Check Vercel Dashboard
   - You should see a new deployment starting automatically
   - Build logs will appear in real-time
