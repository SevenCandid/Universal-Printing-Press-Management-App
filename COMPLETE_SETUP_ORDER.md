# üìã Complete Setup Order - Fixed Version

Follow these steps in order to set up everything correctly.

---

## üéØ The Right Order

### Step 1: Run Old Features SQL (3 min)
**File:** `setup-FIXED.sql`

This creates:
- ‚úÖ `top_customers` view (without email column)
- ‚úÖ Storage policies for `order-files` bucket

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and run: setup-FIXED.sql
```

---

### Step 2: Run New Features SQL (5 min)
**File:** `setup-new-features-FIXED.sql`

This creates:
- ‚úÖ `notifications` table
- ‚úÖ Adds missing columns to `orders` (including `customer_email`)
- ‚úÖ Creates notification triggers
- ‚úÖ Storage policies for `company_files` bucket

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and run: setup-new-features-FIXED.sql
```

---

### Step 3: Update Top Customers View (1 min)

Now that `customer_email` column exists, update the view:

```sql
-- Run this to add email to the view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW top_customers AS
SELECT
  customer_name,
  customer_phone,
  customer_email,  -- NOW this column exists!
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
  SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name, customer_phone, customer_email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### Step 4: Create Storage Buckets (3 min)

**Create TWO buckets:**

1. **Bucket 1:** `order-files`
   - Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí New Bucket
   - Name: `order-files`
   - Privacy: Private
   - For: Per-order file uploads

2. **Bucket 2:** `company_files`
   - Same steps
   - Name: `company_files`
   - Privacy: Private
   - For: Company-wide file storage

---

### Step 5: Enable Realtime (1 min) - WHEN AVAILABLE

**Only if Realtime is available in your Supabase project:**

1. Go to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Enable for `notifications` table
3. Enable for `orders` table (optional, for order updates)
4. Select events: INSERT, UPDATE

**If "Coming Soon":**
- Skip for now
- All features still work
- Notifications require page refresh

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After completing all steps:

```sql
-- 1. Check top_customers view works
SELECT * FROM top_customers;

-- 2. Check notifications table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications;

-- 3. Check new columns exist in orders
SELECT customer_email, due_date, notes, updated_at 
FROM orders LIMIT 1;

-- 4. Check all storage policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
AND tablename = 'objects';
-- Should see ~8 policies (4 for order-files, 4 for company_files)

-- 5. Check triggers
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%notification%';
-- Should see order_created_notification trigger
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### "View contains errors"
**Fix:** Run Step 3 to update the view with customer_email

### "Policy already exists"
**Fix:** Ignore - means it was already created, which is fine

### "Bucket not found" 
**Fix:** Create both buckets in Step 4

### "Realtime not available"
**Fix:** Skip Step 5, features still work without it
